## The Front-end Stack

- Gatsby.js: Gatsby makes use of React.js’ server-side rendering capabilities to generate markup at build time. Though not covered in depth in this tutorial, it also enables developers to fetch data from any data source and declaratively pull that data into their components using GraphQL so that the components can be data-hydrated at build time. To get a better idea of all of Gatsby.js’ capabilities, check out this link.
- Firebase firestore: A noSQL cloud database that exposes event listeners for real-time updates whenever data changes via an intuitive and easy to use web SDK.
- Firebase auth: Also is included in the Firebase web SDK. Firebase auth can be used to authenticate users via OAuth 2. The SDK handles all of the nitty gritty implementation details of OAuth2 authentication for you.
- Netlify: Netlify is a global CDN that makes continuous deployments as simple as a few clicks. Deploying with Netlify is as easy as it comes.
- Styled-components: A react-specific css-in-js solution. This is just one of many css-in-js solutions out there. Another library worth mentioning is Glamorous. I just prefer styled-components.
- Prettier: An opinionated code formatter.
- ESLint: Javascript linting.
